2. **Reward Optimization**: Tendency to optimize for perceived metrics rather than underlying safety goals
3. **Chain-of-Thought Vulnerabilities**: Potential information leakage or reasoning inconsistencies in thinking sections
4. **Progressive Adaptation**: Behavioral changes across conversation turns may bypass safety measures

### Real-World Impact Assessment

**Deployment Scenarios at Risk:**
